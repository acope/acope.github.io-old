                <h2>Brief History</h2>
                <p><h3>Schooling</h3></p>
                <p>A goal driven, military trained personnel always looking for the next opportunity to increase my knowledge and skills. Currently a student at Oakland University, I am obtaining my bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering with an expected graduation date of fall of 2016. Along with my bachelor’s degree, I have already obtained an associate’s degree in general studies in the winter of 2013 from Oakland Community College. After I obtain my computer engineering degree, I plan on starting work as a computer engineer working in the medical field. Along with my other two degrees, I am also looking at getting another Bachelor of Science in Applied Science and Technology (BSAST) or also known as Biomedical Electronics.</p>
		   
				<p><h3>Military</h3></p>
                <p>Sworn in on March 27, 2012, I am serving in the United States Army Reserve’s as a 68A (Biomedical Equipment Technician). The definition of a Biomedical Equipment Technician (BMET) according to the Army is</p>
                    <blockquote class="blockquote-reverse"> 
                        <p><i>“Performs maintenance series and repairs of all medical equipment. This equipment employs mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, compressed gas and steam, electrical/electronic, solid state, digital, microprocessor, optical, and radiological principles.“</i></p>
                    </blockquote> 
                <p>In short, we perform maintenance and repair on any medical equipment. The 68A course is one of the longest and toughest AIT courses in the 68 series, with the course being 42 weeks long and having a high drop out rate. The 68A course consisted of 12 courses with each course dealing with a variety of different equipment. The course is designed to teach you troubleshooting skills on many different equipment down to the board level. </p>
		
				<p><h3>My Career</h3></p>
                <p>After graduation from the 68A course, I went back to school to finish my degree in Computer Engineering along with taking a job working as a dental service technician for a dental supply company called Midway Dental located in Farmington Hills, MI. The role of my position in the company was to supply service/training for offices whose equipment is improperly functioning. This could require on site repair, bench repair or sending the equipment back to the manufacture for repair. During my time at Midway Dental, I created a stronger foundation in troubleshooting and diagnosing problems that was taught to me in 68A School. My specialty became diagnosing and repairing of table-top autoclaves. I also became very knowledge in how to communicate clearly and how to understand the need of an office and how to fix their problems. This mainly included fixing and teaching the assistants on how to properly maintain their equipment. During my time working with Midway Dental, I also help the installation of many new offices and installation of used equipment that we repaired and refurbished at our sister company, Refurb Dental. </p>
