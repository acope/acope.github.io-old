                <h2>Brief History</h2>
                <p><h3>Schooling</h3></p>
                <p>A goal driven, military trained personnel always looking for the next opportunity to increase my knowledge and skills. Currently a graduated student Oakland University with a degree in Computer Engineering. Originally starting my schooling at Oakland Community College, I have also obtained an associate’s degree in general studies in the winter of 2013. I am planning on going back to school to complete my second major in Electrical Engineering and eventually continue my studies into my masters degree.</p>
		   
				<p><h3>Military</h3></p>
                <p>Sworn in on March 27, 2012, I am serving in the United States Army Reserve’s as a 68A (Biomedical Equipment Technician). The definition of a Biomedical Equipment Technician (BMET) according to the Army is</p>
                    <blockquote class="blockquote-reverse"> 
                        <p><i>“Performs maintenance series and repairs of all medical equipment. This equipment employs mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, compressed gas and steam, electrical/electronic, solid state, digital, microprocessor, optical, and radiological principles.“</i></p>
                    </blockquote> 
                <p>In short, we perform maintenance and repair on any medical equipment. The 68A course is one of the longest and toughest AIT courses in the 68 series, with the course being 42 weeks long and having a high drop out rate. The 68A course is located on Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas. It consists of 12 courses, each course dealing with a variety of different equipment. During each course, you had a lecture and lab portion. During the lecture portion you were expected to take up to 6 quizzes a day to test your knowledge of the subject. From the lecture to the lab you were expcted to troubleshoot and perform preventative maintenenace on the equipment for that specific course. Depending on the course, you could have as little as 2 peices of equipment to work on or up to 5 pieces of equipment. The 68A course is designed to teach you preventative maintenance and troubleshooting skills on many different equipment. As well as teaching you to look for the small pieces of information to better be able to service a piece of equipment.</p>
		
				<p><h3>My Career</h3></p>
                <p>I started working when I was 16, getting a job at Quiznos. I quickly grew from being a worker to a shift leader at my shop. I learned how to be responsible for money and working with customers. I was also given the task of training new employees on how to properly make subs and keep the store neat and clean for proper food handling. After working at that Quiznos location for a year and a half that location closed. I quickly found another job working at another Quiznos location. Putting my skills to work that I had learned at my first location, I grew to be a valuable member of that team. Along with starting my job at the new location, I also had started attending classes full time at Oakland Community College. After growing my skills at my new location for about a year, the owners of that location went into bankrupcy and the location closed. Luckily, my time being unemployed did not last that long.</p>
    <p>I was offered a job working at The Home Depot on the night shift freight team. I was able to put some of my learned skills to use at Home Depot. I was able to quickly change my tempo of working and serving food to helping customers find specific product for their home project needs. Some of my duties of being on the freight team were packing out product that came in on the truck, front facing product and packing up product to the racking above that did not fit on the shelf. As well as working on the freight team, I was also assigned the duty of working on the garden recovery team. Here I learned a great deal more about the garden department which included the different types of plants that Home Depot carried as well as all of the mulch and fertilizer. During my time of being on the garden recovery team, I was liscensed on how to drive the different machines that Home Depot used. I was given my license for the hi-lo fork lift, reach tuck, order picker, electric pallet jack, and slip sheet. To increase my skills as a worker at Home Depot, I would regulary take morning shifts working in the garden department and hardware department to learn more about the operation and management of the store. After being at Home Depot for around 4 years, I joined the Army Reserves. During this time I went on leave at Home Depot as well as taking a break from my Computer Engineering degree until I had completed my schooling for the 68A course.</p>
                    
                   <p> After graduation from the 68A course, I went back to school to finish my degree in Computer Engineering. I also went back to working at Home Depot but this time working on the morning shift freight team. Here I learned a completely different side of the working at the Home Depot taking along with what I had already knew and combining it with new skills. After a month of being back, I was offered a job working as a dental service technician for a dental supply company called Midway Dental located in Farmington Hills, MI. The role of my position in the company was to supply service/training for offices whose equipment is improperly functioning. This could require on site repair, bench repair or sending the equipment back to the manufacture for repair. During my time at Midway Dental, I created a stronger foundation in troubleshooting and diagnosing problems that was taught to me in 68A School. My specialty became diagnosing and repairing of table-top autoclaves. I also became very knowledge in how to communicate clearly and how to understand the need of an office and how to fix their problems. This mainly included fixing and teaching the assistants on how to properly maintain their equipment. During my time working with Midway Dental, I also help the installation of many new offices and installation of used equipment that we repaired and refurbished at our sister company, Refurb Dental.</p>
	<p>While studying at Oakland University, I became a teacher assistant for EGR 280 (Electrical Mechanical Design and Analysis). During my time as a TA, I would help students in the lab to develop simple code for the Dragon12+ board using a HCS12 microprocessor with code written in C. I also created and distributed homeworks and quizes to help improve the students knowledge of the board. I was a TA for EGR 280 for three semesters until I accepted a position at Wineman Technology.</p>
	<p>I accepted a position at Wineman Technology as a summer intern. Wineman Technology's singular focus is to design and develop test equipment for advanced research and development, functional test labs, and production test. They were able to perform this ability by developing their test systems using LabView. LabView is a drag and drop style of code where everything is given to you as an icon and you drop what you need. This allows for a faster development of creation of GUI designs but requires a massive computer overhead due to the shear size of the program. During my 5 month internship with Wineman, I learned the style of designing with LabView and also developed and maintained the virtual machines for the support of legacy code. Once my time was finished at Wineman I accepted at job at Fiat Chrysler Automotive (FCA).</p>
